    <p><b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>

    <br>[Turning her head a little.] Have you been round the garden, Miss
    Wangel?<br>


    <b>HILDA.</b><br>

    Yes, I have been taking a look at it.<br>


    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

    And found some flowers too, I see.<br>


    <b>HILDA.</b><br>

    Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.<br>


    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

    Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.<br>


    <b>HILDA.</b><br>

    [Closer.] What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
    then?<br>


    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

    [With a faint smile.] I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.<br>


    <b>HILDA.</b><br>

    Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
    things there?<br>


    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

    It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.<br></p>
