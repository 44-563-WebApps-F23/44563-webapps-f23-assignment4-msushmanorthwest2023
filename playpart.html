        Wangel?</p>


    <h6 class="HILDA">HILDA.</h6>



    <p class="speech">Yes, I have been taking a look at it.</p>


    <h6 class="MRS. SOLNES">MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>

    <p class="speech">And found some flowers too, I see.</p>


    <h6 class="HILDA">HILDA.</h6>

    <p class="speech">Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.</p>


    <h6 class="MRS. SOLNESS">MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>

    <p class="speech">Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.</p>

    <p class="speech">What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,

    <h6 class="HILDA">HILDA.</h6>

    <p class="speech">Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
        things there?</p>


    <h6 class="MRS. SOLNES">MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>

    <p class="speech">It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.</p>
